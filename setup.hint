ldesc: "This OCaml library implements the Wu-Manber algorithm for string 
searching with errors, popularized by the 'agrep' Unix command and the 
'glimpse' file indexing tool. It was developed as part of a search 
engine for a largish MP3 collection; the 'with error' searching comes 
handy for those who can't spell Liszt or Shostakovitch."
